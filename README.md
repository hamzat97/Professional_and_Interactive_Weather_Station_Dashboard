## Professional_and_Interactive_Weather_Station_Dashboard_using_Django
Climate information has endless uses today, and climate monitoring helps provide users with the information they need to plan their actions more effectively. This work presents a professional and intercative dashboard for monitoring and real-time visualization of measurements made by a weather station and downloading of meteorological data in CSV format (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.). This dashboard was developed using Django framework.

### How to use this dashboard?
- Install Django.
- Install all the necessary libraries (if they are missing).
- Feed the database with the climatic information to monitor (in my case for example, I used an API which allows me to retrieve the necessary information for the dashboard: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, maximum wind gust, solar radiation, precipitation level).
- Deploy and enjoy.

Finally, you can easily make the necessary modifications to this dashboard in order to adapt it to your own projects and I remain at your entire disposal, just contact me on my personal Gmail hamzataous847@gmail.com if you have any questions or if you need help.
